%\section{Signal Quality Verification}
%Noise floor analysis (Input-shorted test).
%Frequency response analysis.

%\section{Synchronization Latency Analysis (Crucial)}
%\subsection{The "Round-Trip" Test}
%A test setup where the tablet flashes the screen AND sends the Hex code. A photodiode measures the screen, and the MONEEE records the Hex code. The time difference is the System Latency.

%\subsection{Jitter Measurement}
%Quantifying the variability of the USB transmission.

%\section{Proof of Concept}
%A pilot recording of a P300 response using the Serious Game on a healthy subject.
