\section{Objectives}

\subsection{General Objective}
To design, implement, and validate a hardware-synchronized embedded EEG acquisition architecture capable of mitigating mixed-signal interference and bounding non-deterministic communication latency to ensure the clinical validity of continuous neurocognitive assessments in pediatric ADHD.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To overcome physical deployment barriers and maximize signal efficiency by characterizing the user-experience of a new EEG cap design and systematically measuring electrode-skin impedance to optimize the initial analog interface.
    \item To design and construct a robust EEG acquisition hardware architecture based on industry standards, quantifying its instrumental noise floor and monitoring computational resource consumption (CPU and RAM) to ensure stability during high-frequency data logging.
    \item To guarantee deterministic event alignment by implementing direct hardware-level synchronization, executing rigorous end-to-end latency, jitter, and multimodal stress tests alongside physiological alpha-blocking validations to prove the elimination of non-deterministic temporal errors.
\end{enumerate}
