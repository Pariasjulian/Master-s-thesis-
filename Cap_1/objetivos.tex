\section{Objectives}

\subsection{General Objective}
To design and implement an EEG signal acquisition architecture optimized for applications in educational and clinical settings, focused on latency reduction and precise event synchronization, to improve the objective assessment of cognitive and emotional patterns in children with ADHD.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analyze the technical limitations of current EEG acquisition systems, including transmission latencies and low channel density.
    \item Develop low-latency algorithms and temporal synchronization strategies to ensure precise alignment between serious game stimuli and EEG responses.
    \item Evaluate the proposed architecture in clinical and educational settings, verifying its effectiveness in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD.
\end{enumerate}
