\label{chap:hardware_architecture}

\section{System Overview \& Block Diagram}
High-level data flow: Electrodes $\to$ ADS1299 $\to$ TM4C1294 $\to$ RPi CM4.

\section{Analog Front-End (AFE)}
Configuration of the ADS1299.
Bias drive implementation (Driven Right Leg) for noise rejection.
Power supply isolation (Battery management integration).

\section{The Digital Core (The Split-Architecture)}
\subsection{Real-Time Unit (TI TM4C1294)}
Chosen for its hardware floating-point unit and deterministic interrupt handling. It acts as the SPI master for the ADS1299.

\subsection{Compute Unit (Raspberry Pi CM4)}
Handling high-bandwidth data storage and potential Wi-Fi transmission.

\subsection{Inter-Processor Communication}
How the TM4C sends data to the RPi (e.g., via high-speed SPI or UART).

\section{The Event Interface (USB-C)}
Hardware implementation of the USB Type-C port.
Signal conditioning: Ensuring the tablet's USB power/data lines do not introduce noise into the EEG ground.
